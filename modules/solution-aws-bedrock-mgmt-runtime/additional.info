create security groups for each endpoint

create bedrock guardrails
naming: guardails-<account>-<region_suffix>-<env>

create cloudwatch log group: clw-log-<account>-<region_suffix>-<env>

deploy all endpoints for all bedrock instances

mgmt. sg should only allow 10.20.0.0/8 on port 443
bedrock runtime should only allow 10.30.0.0/16 and 10.40.0.0/16
two other services should be limited to vpc address rnage on port 443


each endpoint should have a vpc endpoint policy which would be read a variable and then if we need to inject terraform objects to it, we will use a local or template file
bedrock run time should be limited to role JQ-12345678-Bedrock in the account
we need to allow arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::found-model/*
we need to allow arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2::found-model/*
we need to allow arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2::found-model/*
we need to allow arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:{my aws partition id}:found-model/*

limit to the vpc endpoint and vpc

allow bedrock:*

we should have an s3 logging bucket with kms 
the cloud logs should use kms
bedrock logging should use the role to upload to s3 and logs should use kms 
guardrail should mask PII data
